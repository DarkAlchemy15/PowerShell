#Get-FileMetaData - is a function that you have to download from technet or Its somewhere on my list of PS scripts

#Notes from tests
#Get-FileMetaData -folder "C:\temp\pic" | select name, Dimensions, width | sort width  #Move-Item -Destination "C:\temp\pic\small_pic\" where {( $_.width -ge "512")}


#Set the folder you want to sort though
$Var = Get-FileMetaData -folder "C:\temp\pic" 

Foreach ($pic in $var) {
    #Tests to see if folder exists
    if (Test-Path C:\temp\done\$($pic.dimensions) ) {
        #Write-host "`n`nFolder "$pic.dimensions" Exist `n`n"
    }
    Else{
        #If it doesn't exist it creates the folder
        new-item -path "C:\temp\done\" -name "$($pic.dimensions)" -ItemType "directory" | out-null
        write-host "`n`nFolder "$pic.dimensions" has been created `n`n"
    }
    #Moves Pictures to proper folders
    #Write-host "`n "$pic.name" has been moved"
    move-item -Path "C:\temp\pic\$($pic.name)" -Destination "C:\temp\done\$($pic.dimensions)"
}
